        <i>First time meeting IRL @Don Edwards Wildlife Refuge</i>
        <p>The first time I met Ariel IRL was at the Don Edwards Wildlife Refuge in Fremont. I met up with her and her friend Chandra. I was ecstatic to meet her in person
	    because prior to this, we had only had a virtual date over Zoom. We had a pleasant sunset hike around the refuge. We had some light conversation but when she 
	    mentioned the film <b>"In the Mood for Love"</b> - I knew immediately she was different. I've always been somewhat of a hipster, so I knew that few people would 
	    recognize this movie. As our walk ended, I was surprised to hear her ask me if I wanted to get some food/dessert. Chandra was departing, and I had assumed that 
	    since she invited a friend on our first date, that she was not completely interested. I agreed and we went to Meet Fresh a Taiwanese dessert shop. It was there
	    that I got to see her face for the first time! Prior to that we had both been wearing masks on our walk.</p>

        <i>Avian Technician</i>
        <p>In 2014, I landed my first job out of college as an avian technician. I worked on an island (East Sand) at the mouth of the Columbia River monitoring Caspian terns, collecting data on nesting location and behavior throughout the field season.</p>

        <i>Fish Health Technician</i>
        <p>Later in 2014, I switched to #teamfish and worked in the Fish Pathology Lab for Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. Through this job I assisted with disease monitoring of hatchery salmonids throughout the state.</p>

        <h3>Bird Research Northwest</h3>
        <i>Seabird Technician</i>
        <p>In 2015, I went back to East Sand Island once again but this time for Bird Research Northwest - a cooperative research group between Oregon State University and Real Time Research an environmental consulting company. This time around I had significantly greater duties monitoring the nesting colony. Along with the field crew, I collected data on banded birds, nest colony counts, active nest counts, and depredation rates.</p>

        <i>Fisheries Observer</i>
        <p>Later in 2015, I took a once in a lifetime opportunity to move to Hawaii where I worked two years as a fisheries observer. There I worked on commercial fishing boats targeting tuna and swordfish, and collected data on species composition, lengths, sex, biological sampling, and protected species interactions for NOAA Fisheries.</p>
        <p>Work on these fishing cruises varied tremendously, ranging from 12 days to 35 days. Life was difficult at times, so far away from civilization but I enjoyed my time in Hawaii greatly.</p>

        <h3>Portland Community College</h3>
        <p>In 2017, I decided to go back to school and further develop my professional skills by pursuing a GIS certificate. During this time I gained
		skills in GIS analysis, UAV operations, cartography, and GPS. </p>

        <h3>Portland Parks and Recreation Urban Forestry</h3>
        <i>GIS and Research Intern</i>
        <p>In 2018 I took the opportunity to intern with the Portland Parks and Recration to work on a project analyzing tree planting equity for
		the City of Portland. This project invovled wrangling planted tree data from the city and its partners over the past 30 years, geocoding 
		tens of thousands of planted tree records, and producing maps with a focus on answering the question of whether or not low income and 
		low canopy neighborhoods are received equal tree plantings and resources.</p>

        <h3>National Parks Service (Mosaics in Science)</h3>
        <i>Assistant Avian Biologist</i>
        <p>In 2018 after I graduated from the GIS program I moved all the way to south Florida to work for the National Parks Service through the 
		Mosaics in Science Program. There I worked with the South Florida and Carribean Monitoring Network and played an active role in utlizing 
		low level aerial photography to determine the number of active nests of of several species of colonial nesting birds within Biscayne 
		National Park as well as geospatially linking it in GIS.<br></br>
        The second part of my internship was a pilot study with the USGS in order to investigate the efficacy of using drones to collect 
		imagery as a replacement to helicopters. I developed a Story Map to present my work which can be viewed <a href="https://arcg.is/1jPDa4">here</a>.

        <h3>University of California Santa Cruz / NOAA</h3>
        <i>Research Associate</i>
        <p>Following the path of natural resources, in 2019 I went on to join the University of California Santa to work as a research associate
		with NOAA Fisheries at the Southwest Fisheries Science Center as a team investigating movement and survival of threatened and endangered
		salmon. I assist with acoustic tagging efforts of juvenile salmon which are released into the river and tracked along their outmigration path
		to the ocean via receivers that we set and manage in the Sacramento River. I have been developing a Shiny App to display our project data
		which can be seen <a href="https://thtupham.shinyapps.io/CentralValley/">here</a>.</p>
