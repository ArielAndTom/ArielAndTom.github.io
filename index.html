        <h3>First Date </h3>
        <h4>📍 Don Edwards Wildlife Refuge </br>📅 10/26/2020</h4>
        <p>
            Where it all began 😊. This was our first date IRL. Prior to this, we had only had a virtual date over Zoom. I met with Ariel and her friend Chandra for an evening hike at 
            Don Edwards Wildlife Refuge in Fremont. After we finished the hike, Chandra left and Ariel and I went to get dessert at Meet Fresh. It was here that I actually go to see her
            face, as we had both been masked at Don Edwards. Wow what a cutie!

        <h3>First Santa Cruz Date</h3>
        <h4>📍 Natural Bridges State Beach </br>📅 11/7/2020</h4>
        <p>
            Our first date in Santa Cruz! I remember being so excited that Ariel was interested enough in me to come all the way to Santa Cruz, which I learned that she never visited 
            because of the scary highway 17. I took her to Natural Bridges to see the monarch butterflies which normally would be migrating and overwintering here, but just my luck!
            That year was a historically poor year for the butterflies and hardly any were to be seen. All was not lost though. After walking through the trails we went to the lookout
            point and I spotted dolphins in the distance. I had my binos with me and quickly shared them with Ariel. I remembered her saying that she hadn't seen dolphins around before
            so I was ecstatic that I could help her spot some!

        <h3>Mount Shasta Vacay 🏔️</h3>
        <h4>📍 Mount Shasta </br>📅 12/28/2020</h4>
        <p>
            The first vacation we ever took together was at Mount Shasta. In the the middle of the pandemic, Shasta County was the only one in the state without travel restrictions so 
            that's where we decided to go 😆. We stayed at nice AirBnB that was right in the backyard of Mount Shasta. You could literally see it through the window! Ariel took me 
            cross-country skiing ⛷️ for the first time! I really had no idea what I was getting into but I trusted her that it would be a good time, and it was. We lucked out on some
            spectacular weather, and there was hardly anyone around. It felt like we had the whole mountain to ourselves. We somehow ended up on a black diamond slope and I recall eating
            it a couple times, but boy what a thrill.

        <h4>📍 Monte Rio </br>📅 4/21/2021</h4>
        <p>
            On our next vacation we spent 5 days up north. At our first stop we stayed in Monte Rio at a lodge sitting along the Russian River, a lovely spot that reminded me a lot of the PNW. 
            We adventured our way up the jagged north coast and made our way to Van Damme State Park where we camped, went up further to the cute town of Mendocino, and kayaked up the pristine
            waters of Big River on an outrigger made of redwoods!

        <p>
            For my big 3 0, we went on another vacay this time down south. Solvang was this Danish styled town both in architecture and food, where we 
            enjoyed beers and marveled in this adult Disneyland. However, the highlight of the trip was the Channel Islands! It took a about 1.5 hours by ferry
            to get to this idyllic island off the coast of Santa Barbara. Santa Cruz island to be exact. What a beautiful island, with stunning views along the trails,
            and my absolute favorite part of the trip - seeing the endemic and super cute island fox! The little guys were the size of cats and very curious.

        <h4>📍 Soda Springs </br>📅 6/3/2021</h4>
        <p>
            What a unique experience. Ariel connected with a friend of her's that had an opportunity to do a photoshoot for Fujifilm in Tahoe as models. When she asked if I wanted
            to join, I was a little hesitant but I'm so glad that I went through with it! We got paid to go live in an AirBnB near Lake Tahoe and have photos of ourselves
            taken with Fujifilm gear. I couldn't believe that a normie like myself was a part of this operation with people who actually model for a living. Afterwards, we went on
            our own mini trip through Lake Tahoe since we were already so close. I had heard about it from so many people, but I had no idea how stunning it truly is.

        <h4>📍 Downtown </br>📅 6/26/2021</h4>
        <p>
            Ariel and I's first international trip together was all the way in Mexico 🇲🇽! We went back and forth about where we wanted to go but ultimately decided on 
            Mexico City where we wanted to have a grand food tour 🍴. We stayed at several locations along the time, but the first was the Downtown Hotel. It was 
            easily the most luxurious hotel I had ever stayed at, and will always remember. Boy, looking back we did a ton of walking and got to see so many parts of the 
            city. We got to see the landmarks of centro histórico, the hip neighborhoods of Roma and Condesa, and the cobbled streets of Coyoacán. From street food to
            fine dining, cochinita pibil to Vietnamese tamarind prawns, CDMX showed us what a vibrant city it is.

        <p>
            Our most recent vacation was at Point Reyes National Seashore. We spent the end of 2021 together at a quaint
            inn (and stables 🐎). It was a lovely getaway for the two of us to just relax and enjoy this beautiful area. 
            In all, we actually got to see quite a bit of the entire park. The trip began at Tony's Seafood Restaurant,
            where we celebrated free oyster 🦪 day. Those BBQ oysters are bomb dot com. It was just a perfect trip 
            enjoying what we love to do - see nature, eat good food, and spend time together 💖.
